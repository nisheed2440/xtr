# XT Tech Radar

[XT Tech Radar](https://xt-techradar.com) is a document that sets out to help us get in touch with the recent trends in technology. What to consider when building up a new tech stack, The scalability and maturity of libraries/framesworks or tools that we use on a day to day basis and how they would play in projects. It reflects the unique opinions of some of the architects, associates and thought-leaders in the field of **eXperience Technology** / __XT__. 

It consists of four quadrants:
* Ubiquitous
* Scale/Grow
* Incubate
* De-emphasize

and three rings:
* Concepts
* Tools/SDK's
* Frameworks

XT Tech Radar is heavily influenced by the pioneering working done by the [Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). The graphing used for the our radar is a fork from the "Thoughtworks Technology Radar" [git repository](https://github.com/thoughtworks/build-your-own-radar) with alot of our own customizations.
